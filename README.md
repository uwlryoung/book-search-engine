This project was initially given as a REST API, and I converted it to use GraphQL and an Apollo Server.

## Installation
No installation necessary. Visit the page [here](https://thawing-refuge-33071-1896c5f319f3.herokuapp.com/). 

## Usage
To use this webpage, make an account by going to "Login/Sign Up". Once you have done that, you are able to search for books by typing in a title in the search bar. If you are logged in, there will be a button below the summary to save the book. To remove it from your saved books, click on "See Your Books" and then at the bottom of the summary, click on "Delete this Book!"

## Credits
Starter Code provided by EdX Fullstack Bootcamp (was a fully functional website, and I was tasked to convert it from a RESTful site to a GraphQL site).
